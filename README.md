# ris-live-example

A quick RIS Live example.

To build:

`go build main/ris.go`

Should generate ./ris; run `./ris`

This will give basically the firehose: any IPv4 update, from any RIS collector. The code has a couple of examples on how to filter the stream.

There's more info in the RIS Live manual: https://ris-live.ripe.net/manual/
